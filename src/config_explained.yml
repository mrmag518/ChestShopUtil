  # OverflowLimit - When a player trades with a shop without having exceeded the limit, but the amount he is about
  # to buy/sell will make him exceed the limit.
  # Example, ADude has bought 99/100 items, but the amount he is about to buy is 5, he would exceed the limit with
  # 104/100 items. Setting the OverflowLimit to 5 would allow ADude to buy with this overflow, as long as he has bought under 100 items.
  # This would mark him as having bought a total of 104/100 items.
